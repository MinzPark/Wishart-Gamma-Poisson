# The Topic : Multivarite Modeling Under Random Effect Model

Key contributions of this research include:

  1. Developing a framework for simulation and real data analysis using the Wishart-Gamma Random Effect Model.
  2. Expanding the concept of the Wishart parameter ($\Sigma$) by leveraging matrix-based methods for parameter estimation and interpretation.

These findings provide a foundation for further exploration of multivariate models and their application in complex real-world data scenarios.
